# Project: Recommendations with IBM
#  Overview
For this project you analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles
# Installation
The code should run using Python versions 3.*. The necessary libraries are:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
pickle

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the data you are working with for the project. Dive in to see some basic information
## 2. Rank Based Recommendations
Find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. 
Assume the articles with the most interactions are the most popular. 
## 3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
Look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. 
This is a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users.
## 4.Matrix Factorization
Complete a machine learning approach to building recommendations.
Using the user-item interactions,I built out a matrix decomposition.
